Description
===========

WinContig is an easy-to-use stand-alone defragmentation tool that doesn't
create any installation directories or Registry entries on your computer. Its
purpose is to quick defragment files without the need to defragment the whole
disk.
In addition, WinContig allows you to group files and folders into profiles for
processing them later. WinContig supports FAT32 and NTFS file systems and it
works with Hard Disks and SSDs.

Most defragmentation tools perform a general defragmentation of an entire
partition. In a real-life scenario, you often want to defragment a single file
or a directory, for example to improve the loading speed of a program file, or
to reduce the loading time of a certain disk intensive application like a game.

WinContig has been designed specifically to meet the needs of users who focus
mainly on files and folders rather than an entire disk.

Its ability to filter files by several criteria combined with its ability to be
controlled via command-line switches, make WinContig the perfect tool to
defragment particular files that are frequently used and continuously becoming
fragmented.

WinContig is an application designed for Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8,
Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11 operating systems, both 32-bit and 64-bit.

You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to
run WinContig.
